# EXP-1-PROMPT-ENGINEERING

## Aim: 
Comprehensive Report on the Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Experiment: 
Develop a comprehensive report for the following exercises:

Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI.
Focusing on Generative AI architectures. (like transformers).
Generative AI applications.
Generative AI impact of scaling in LLMs.

## Algorithm:
Here are the steps of the process:

**Deconstruct the Request:** The initial request was broken down into its core components: foundational concepts, architectures (specifically Transformers), applications, and the impact of scaling in LLMs.

**Structure the Report:** These core components were used to create the main sections of the report in a logical, top-down order, starting with general definitions and moving to specific details and future implications.

**Synthesize Information:** All provided research materials were reviewed to extract relevant information for each section. This involved grouping related concepts together, such as GANs, VAEs, and Transformers, and separating information on applications by domain and industry.

**Draft the Narrative:** The report was written section by section, starting with a high-level summary. The narrative was constructed to connect the extracted information into a cohesive and comprehensive document.

**Integrate Evidence:** Every factual statement, definition, and example in the report was directly supported by a corresponding reference from the provided materials.

**Review and Refine:** The final report was reviewed for accuracy, consistency, and flow to ensure it was a polished and professional response that fully addressed the original query.
