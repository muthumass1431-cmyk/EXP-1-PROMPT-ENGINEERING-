## Aim: 
Comprehensive Report on the Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
Experiment: Develop a comprehensive report for the following exercises:

Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI.
Focusing on Generative AI architectures. (like transformers).
Generative AI applications.
Generative AI impact of scaling in LLMs.

## Algorithm:
Early models: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

Transformers: The game-changer. Key features:

Self-attention mechanism.

Handles long-range dependencies.

Scales efficiently with more data and parameters.

Goal: Produce a comprehensive report covering Foundations of Generative AI, Architectures (esp. Transformers), Applications, Impact of scaling in LLMs.

Inputs Topic outline (the 4 sections above) Style constraints (academic tone, headings, figures/diagrams to suggest, citations if allowed) Model(s): LLM of your choice (e.g., “writer”), optional “critic” model (can be the same model with a different system prompt) (Optional) Knowledge sources: lecture notes, textbooks, papers, web sources

Outputs Final report (Markdown/Word/PDF) (Optional) Appendix with prompts used and model metadata
## Output

## Result
A comprehensive report on Generative AI and LLMs was successfully generated using prompt engineering, covering foundational concepts, architectures, applications, and scaling impacts. This demonstrates the effectiveness of structured prompts in producing accurate and well-organized academic content.
